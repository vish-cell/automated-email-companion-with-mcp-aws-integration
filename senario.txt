)   Meeting Completion
        After a meeting concludes, a company representative drafts and sends a summary email through Outlook.
        The email contains details such as discussion points, decisions, and technical topics covered in the meeting.

2)  Email Reception in Outlook
        The summary email reaches the recipient’s Outlook inbox.
        Outlook serves as the primary data source for the system.

3)  MCP Server 1 – Context Extraction
        MCP 1 connects to Outlook using the Microsoft Graph API.

        It automatically fetches all meeting summary emails within a specified date range.
        MCP 1 extracts key information such as context, topics, and keywords from the email body.

4)  MCP Server 2 – Knowledge Enrichment
        The processed summary from MCP 1 is sent to MCP 2.

        MCP 2 searches through AWS Documentation and relevant online sources.
        It identifies and ranks related articles, SDK links, and technical resources that match the meeting’s discussion topics.

5)  Frontend / Dashboard – Information Display
        The frontend presents:
            a) The original meeting summary (fetched from Outlook)
            b) The recommended AWS documents and resources (provided by MCP 2)
            c) An auto-generated draft email suggesting follow-up actions 
            The user can review, edit, and send this follow-up email directly.

Overall Workflow
    Outlook → MCP 1 (fetch + analyze) → MCP 2 (enrich + recommend) → Frontend (display + interaction)
    This pipeline ensures automation, relevance, and professional integration.
    Since MCP servers already handle workflow logic, n8n or external orchestrators are not required.
